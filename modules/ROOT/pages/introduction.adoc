== Introduction

The SC-OBC Module V1 is a space-grade single-board computer that integrates the AMD Versal AI Edge Series VE2302 as its main processor. AMD Versal is a high-performance device implementing a heterogeneous computing (Adaptive SoC) architecture that combines a CPU, FPGA, and AI Engine. It enables efficient processing of large-scale sensor data—such as optical sensors, SAR, and LiDAR—including input preprocessing, hardware acceleration, vector-based edge computing, and high-capacity data recording.

A Microchip IGLOO2 device is implemented as a safety processor to perform health monitoring of the main processor. The hardware is composed of radiation-tolerant devices and industrial-grade components with proven radiation resistance, ensuring high reliability in space environments.
