== Programmable Logic Development

All Programmable Logic (PL) in the SC-OBC Module V1 is fully accessible to the user,
allowing mission-specific functions to be freely implemented to meet spacecraft requirements.

=== Programmable Logic Resources

The Programmable Logic of the SC-OBC Module V1 provides access to the following resources:

=== Programmable Logic Design Method

Designing the PL involves modifying the Block Design hierarchy or the top-level module (`sc_obc_v1_versal.v`).
This approach follows the standard AMD MPSoC/FPGA design methodology.

For more information on Versal design techniques, refer to the *Versal Adaptive SoC Design Guide*.
