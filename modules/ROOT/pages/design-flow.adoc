== Design Flow

The development of the Versal on the SC-OBC Module V1 can be carried out in two ways:
using the Vivado GUI or using the command-line flow with RTL and Tcl scripts.

The Makefile included in the development environment provides two main targets:
`create_versal_ps_bd` and `build_fpga`.

The following diagram illustrates the primary development flow for the SC-OBC-V1 FPGA.

=== GUI Design Flow

This method uses the Vivado GUI for design work.
First, run the `create_versal_ps_bd` target, then open and modify the Vivado project as needed.

The project can be opened using the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
cd versal/work/implement
vivado project/sc_obc_v1_versal.xpr
----

After completing the design in Vivado, close the application and run the `build_fpga` target.
This will export the `.pdi` and `.xsa` files generated from your design.

[CAUTION]
====
When using this flow, running `make clean` will remove the generated design files.
If you perform design work in the GUI, it is strongly recommended to migrate your changes into scripts.

=== CLI Design Flow

This method uses RTL and Tcl scripts for design.
The `create_versal_ps_bd` target includes entry points for loading RTL files and executing user scripts.

The following files are provided for users to add RTL or Tcl-based design logic:

* **rtl/user_rtl.list**
  Lists the user RTL files to be loaded by Vivado.
  Any RTL added to this file is automatically included during the build.

* **script/implement/user_bd_logic.tcl**
  A Tcl script for applying custom logic to the Block Design hierarchy.
  This script is executed at the end of the Block Design generation process.

* **constraints/sc-obc-v1-versal-user-io.xdc**
  Constraint file for user-defined I/O.
  Used to specify pin assignments, pad numbers, I/O buffer configurations, drive strengths, and other I/O-related settings.
